					<strong class="h4">Swimming</strong> is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation,
					sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and
					the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. Humans can hold their
					breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival
					response.<br><br>

					Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries,
					swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum. As a formalized sport,
					swimming is featured in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every
					modern Summer Olympics.<br><br>

					Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes in order to propel the body forward. While the
					front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest of the four main strokes,
					other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as training.

					Swimming relies on the <strong class="h4">nearly neutral buoyancy</strong> of the human body. On average, the body has a relative density of 0.98 compared to water, which causes the body to float. However, buoyancy varies on the basis of body composition, lung inflation, muscle and fat content, centre of gravity and the salinity of the water. Higher levels of body fat and saltier water both lower the relative density of the body and increase its buoyancy. Human males tend to have a lower centre of gravity and higher muscle content, therefore find it more difficult to float or be buoyant. See also: Hydrostatic weighing.<br><br>
					
					Since the human body is less dense than water, water is able to support the weight of the body during swimming. As a result, swimming is "low-impact" compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.

					Swimming has been recorded <strong class="h4">since prehistoric times</strong>, and the earliest records of swimming date back to Stone Age paintings from around 7,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC. Some of the earliest references include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), Beowulf, and other sagas.<br><br>

					The coastal tribes living in the volatile[clarification needed] Low Countries were known as excellent swimmers by the Romans. Men and horses of the Batavi tribe could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. Dio Cassius describes one surprise tactic employed by Aulus Plautius against the Celts at the Battle of the Medway:

					The [British Celts] thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of [Batavii], who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. ... Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found, but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the [Batavii] swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them.
